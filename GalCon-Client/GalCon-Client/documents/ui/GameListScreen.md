GameListScreen for in progress games
-----

Taking inspiration from the dual progress bar I saw here [Dual Progress Bar](http://ui-patterns.com/collections/lists/entry/9778), 
I think it would be cool to have each list element on this screen represent the current state of the game. This would be state with
regard to who currently is at an advantage. Things to think about here would be;

* Number of ships at planets
* Number of planets held
* Regen rates of those planets
* Number of moves in progress
* Number of ability planets held

	This would help set some context on each game when the user is on this screen.

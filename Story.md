Battle Star Galactica theme. A race who have been enjoying a long period of peace in what they thought was a safe part of the galaxy are now under attack and close to extinction.

The story segments would be shown after the user enters a new map for the first time which they have not viewed on their device before. We could use the preference store to track this (This would mean that you would see the story multiple times if you use multiple devices, possibly not a big deal). A "Skip" button would be present for anyone who doesnt want to read the story.

We could tell the story from the perspective of the commander. Have the segments be more like diary entries then one grand narrative.

One idea was to have a slighlty different tone or outcome for your current win/loss ratio.

1. Introduction
    
Stories, thats what my father always told me they were. Once whole solar systems started falling to this new enemy, the stories felt very real. After a millennia of peace we find ourselves, the last of the guardians, unprepared. Our forces slowly reduced overtime to accommodate more intellectual pursuits, the old colonies now abandoned in favor of the home system. Settlements once thriving left to starve and rot. 
    
When the enemy came, they came in force. Stories of slaughter in the outer colonies finally stirring the council into action. As a race we had left such brutality behind, a relic of a time where once we ruled the stars. Now was the time to resurrect the past, to restore the order we once swore to protect. Now is a time for guardians. 

2. Moving on
3. Speed
4. Protect
5. Annihilation
6. Power

Battle Star Galactica theme. A race who have been enjoying a long period of peace in what they thought was a safe part of the galaxy are now under attack and close to extinction.

The story segments would be shown after the user enters a new map for the first time which they have not viewed on their device before. We could use the preference store to track this (This would mean that you would see the story multiple times if you use multiple devices, possibly not a big deal). A "Skip" button would be present for anyone who doesnt want to read the story.

We could tell the story from the perspective of the commander. Have the segments be more like diary entries then one grand narrative.

One idea was to have a slighlty different tone or outcome for your current win/loss ratio.

1. Introduction
2. Moving on
3. Speed
4. Protect
5. Annihilation
6. Power
